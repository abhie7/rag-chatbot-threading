## Spokane Airport Board

### Request for Proposals (RFP)

#### for
## Website Design, Development and Maintenance Services

Spokane International Airport (Airport) owns three main websites: the primary, traveler-facing
Spokane International Airport website (spokaneairports.net), a business-focused website
(business.spokaneairports.net) and the Felts Field website (feltsfield.spokaneairports.net). The
Airport is soliciting Proposals from qualified professional firms to replace these sites with up to
three new, redesigned site(s), and to provide ongoing website hosting and maintenance services
for up to (5) five years with (2) two optional one-year extensions.

#### Background Information

**ABOUT THE AIRPORT:**
The Airport is jointly owned by Spokane County and the City of Spokane. The city and county
[operate the airports under provisions of RCW 14.08, which establishes the operation of airports](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=14.08)
by more than one municipality under joint agreement. The operating authority is the Spokane
Airport Board (the “Board”), consisting of seven appointees from the two governmental bodies.
[For more information see “About Spokane International Airport”.](https://business.spokaneairports.net/about-spokane-international/)

   - **Spokane International Airport (GEG): Situated just five miles west of downtown, GEG**
is the second largest commercial service airport in the state of Washington, and an
important gateway to key markets and destinations across the Inland Northwest and
British Columbia. It is served by seven major airlines (Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta,
Southwest, Sun Country and United) and three cargo carriers, and provides employment
for over 3,000 people. The Airport’s market area includes Eastern Washington, Northern
Idaho, Western Montana and portions of Southern British Columbia and Alberta. In 2023,
the airport proudly welcomed a record total of more than 4.13 million passengers and
handled 77,398 tons of cargo. It also generates approximately $3 billion in economic
impact across the Inland Northwest region – and does so without the use of taxpayer or
City or County appropriated funds. Later this year, the Airport expects to adopt a new
logo and brand identity, which will be incorporated into the new website design.

   - **Felts Field (SFF) is a 400-acre general aviation airport and designated reliever facility**
located approximately five miles east of downtown Spokane. It has two paved runways,
a turf landing strip, as well as the ability to accommodate water landings on the adjacent
Spokane River. In 2023, the airport supported 70,218 aircraft operations.

   - **The Airport Business Park is an industrial and business park development that**
comprises 540 acres. Strategically located adjacent to the airport Spokane International
Airport and Interstate 90, it has 19 buildings and 8 tenants.

The Airport envisions the Airport Area as a world-class, aerospace-focused transportation,
logistics, and advanced manufacturing center and it is the expectation the newly designed
websites reflect and help advance this vision.

#### Spokane International Airport RFP for Website Design, Development and Maintenance Services Page 2 of 13

By 2030, more than 6.2 million passengers are expected to pass through Spokane International
Airport. The Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) Program is the Airport’s multi-year,
multi-phase initiative designed to expand and enhance its terminal facility to accommodate this
demand. The first phase of the program is the Concourse C Expansion Project: a $150 million,
144,000 square foot addition to the Airport’s existing terminal building that will be completed in
stages through 2025. Subject to future funding, other components of the TREX Program include
a Central Hall with a consolidated security screening checkpoint and baggage claim area, as
well as modernized A and B Concourses.

Over the last decade, Spokane Airports has also become increasingly involved in regional and
statewide aerospace industry sector’s business recruitment, retention, and expansion
strategies. The Airport focuses on firms located in Asia and Europe that support aircraft interiors
and/or aerostructures, and routinely participates in trade shows and air shows throughout
Europe and Asia. It is also one of the founding members of the local aerospace cluster, the
“Inland Northwest Aerospace Consortium (INWAC);” which has rebranded as the Northwest I90
Manufacturing Alliance; has led the State’s largest aerospace trade association, the “Aerospace
Futures Alliance of Washington;” were a foundational supporter that led to the Tech Hub
designation for the American Aerospace Manufacturing Materials Center, and have been active
in supporting a variety of workforce development initiatives at the community college level.
During this time, there have been a number of successful aerospace business recruitment
efforts including Associated Painters, Exotic Metals Forming Company, Absolute Aviation
Services, and Aero-Flite.

Additionally, the Airport has led the development of a brand-new Rail-Truck Transload Facility.
Located approximately two miles west of the passenger terminal, this facility will offer multimodal
freight movement services to meet the increased demand for a larger transportation network
from the area’s diverse commercial and industrial sectors.

**The new website(s) should reflect the unique identity and character of the Airport and the**
**communities it serves and be easily scalable to accommodate the Airport’s future**
**growth.**

**CURRENT WEBSITES:**
The Airport’s three main websites were designed and launched over 10 years ago:

1. **[https://spokaneairports.net/.](https://spokaneairports.net/)** Primary site audiences include travelers, general public

and “meeters and greeters”. The site has more than 50 individual webpages. Notably, it
displays real-time flight information imported from third-party flight data provider OAG.

**2.** **[https://business.spokaneairports.net/.](https://business.spokaneairports.net/)** Primary site audiences include airport business

partners and tenants, Airport employees. The site has more than 50 individual webpages.
It does not include a dedicated Investors Relations section, which will be necessary to
include in the redesigned website(s).

**3.** **[https://feltsfield.spokaneairports.net/.](https://feltsfield.spokaneairports.net/)** Primary site audiences include Airport users,

general aviation enthusiasts, community members and Airport tenants. The site contains
approximately 20 individual webpages.

#### Spokane International Airport RFP for Website Design, Development and Maintenance Services Page 3 of 13


-----

The current, proprietary webhosting platform does not yield web traffic analytics. It also does not
support the scale of high-resolution imagery and rich media assets needed to reflect the Airport’s
new modern look and feel.

The Airport maintains other smaller, targeted websites [(https://gegtrex.com/;](https://gegtrex.com/)
[https://spokaneaero.com/) that are not included in this scope. However, it is crucial the newly](https://spokaneaero.com/)
designed sites be dynamic enough to build and expand upon these excluded website, if needed,
as well as be complementary.

The Airport also has a separate “Employment” website through web-based employment service
Neo-Gov. This page mirrors the appearance and theme of the Spokane Airports master site but
is constructed and stored on the third-party Neo-Gov site. The selected firm will work with Airport
IT, Airport Marketing and Neo-Gov to change the page formatting on this employment site to align
with the redesigned master site.
